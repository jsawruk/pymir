        # From an explicit constructor - e.g. InfoArray():

        #    (we're in the middle of the InfoArray.__new__
        #    constructor, and self.info will be set when we return to

        # From new-from-template - e.g infoarr[:3]

        #
        # Note that it is here, rather than in the __new__ method,
        # that we set the default value for 'info', because this
        # method sees all creation of default objects - with the
        # InfoArray.__new__ constructor, but also with
        # arr.view(InfoArray).
